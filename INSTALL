Installation
--------------------------------------------------------

The McSMAC code is posted on github.  It is intended to be fairly 
easy to install for POSIX systems.  Windows users, you are out of 
luck.  McSMAC will not run on a windows machine.

License Issues with the Multicore Workqueue
--------------------------------------------------------

The multicore component of McSMAC depends on a workqueue 
implementation borrowed, without permission, from David Butenhof's 
text, ``Programming With POSIXÂ® Threads.''  This code can be 
downloaded from the author's website, however, there is no 
explicit licensing documentation available.  Therefore, any person 
compiling or using McSMAC with dependencies on the workqueue code 
does so at their own peril and agrees to accept any and all legal 
risks associated with such use.  Unless you make a conscious 
decision to enable the Butenhof workqueue, McSMAC will run as a 
single thread.

--------------------------------------------------------
Instructions to Enable the Butenhof WorkQueue
--------------------------------------------------------

To enable the Butenhof dependencies, follow the instructions in 
the Makefile.  You will have toenable a build flag in the Makefile, 
manually download the files, and apply the patch.

--------------------------------------------------------
Building on a Mac
--------------------------------------------------------

See the comments in the Makefile.  There is a comment and 
corresponding build flag that can be used.  This is experimental, 
with only light testing on Mac OS X.
